# This test is not run automatically.
#
# It requires > 2gb memory for the >2 gigapixel image generated in the
# second test.  Running this automatically would amount to a denial of
# service on our testing infrastructure.  I expect this test to fail
# on any 32-bit machine, as well as any smallish things (like
# Raspberry Pis). It does succeed on a 3gb Ubuntu 12.04x64 VM on Python
# 2.7 and 3.2.
