# Enhanced Fuzz Target for Pillow: EXIF Metadata Fuzzing

This fuzz target focuses on testing the EXIF metadata handling capabilities of Pillow, which is an area not specifically targeted by the existing fuzzers.

## Features

This fuzz target specifically tests:

1. EXIF metadata extraction from images
2. Processing of EXIF tags and values
3. GPS information handling
4. Thumbnail extraction from EXIF data

## Integration

To integrate this fuzz target:

1. Save it as `fuzz_exif.py` in the `Tests/oss-fuzz/` directory
2. Update the `build.sh` script to include this target in the build process
3. Test locally to ensure it works correctly
4. Submit as part of a pull request to the Pillow repository

## Expected Benefits

- Increased coverage of EXIF metadata handling code
- Potential discovery of bugs in metadata parsing
- Better handling of malformed EXIF data
- Improved security for applications processing images with metadata
