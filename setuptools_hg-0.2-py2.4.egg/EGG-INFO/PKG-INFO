Description: 
        setuptools_hg
        =============
        
        setuptools_hg is a plugin for setuptools that enables setuptools to find files
        under the Mercurial version control system.
        
        It uses the Mercurial Python library by default and falls back to use the
        command line programm ``hg(1)``. That's especially useful inside virtualenvs
        that don't have access to the system wide installed Mercurial lib (e.g. when
        created with ``--no-site-packages``).
        
        .. note:: The setuptools feature
        
        You can read about the hooks used by setuptool_hg in the
        `setuptools documentation`_. It basically returns a list of files that are
        under Mercurial version control when running the ``setup`` function, e.g. if
        you create a source and binary distribution. It's a simple yet effective way
        of not having to define package data (non-Python files) manually in MANIFEST
        templates (``MANIFEST.in``).

        Usage
        *****
        
        Here's an example of a setup.py that uses setuptools_hg::
        
        from setuptools import setup, find_packages
        setup(
        name="HelloWorld",
        version="0.1",
        packages=find_packages(),
        setup_requires=["setuptools_hg"],
        )
        
        If you run this setup.py setuptools will automatically download setuptools_hg
        to the directory where the setup.py is located at (and won't install it
        anywhere else) to get all package data files from the Mercurial repository.
        
        Options
        *******
        
        Set the ``HG_SETUPTOOLS_FORCE_CMD`` environment variable before running
        setup.py if you want to enforce the use of the hg command.
