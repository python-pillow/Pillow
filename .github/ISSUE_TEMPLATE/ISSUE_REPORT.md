Thank you for reporting an issue.

Follow these guidelines to ensure your issue is handled properly.

If you have a ...

1.  General question: consider asking the question on Stack Overflow
    with the python-imaging-library tag:

    * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python-imaging-library

    Do not ask a question in both places.

    If you think you have found a bug or have an unexplained exception
    then file a bug report here.

2.  Bug report: include a self-contained, copy-pastable example that
    generates the issue if possible. Be concise with code posted.
    Guidelines on how to provide a good bug report:

    * https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve

    Bug reports which follow these guidelines are easier to diagnose,
    and are often handled much more quickly.

3.  Feature request: do a quick search of existing issues
    to make sure this has not been asked before.

We know asking good questions takes effort, and we appreciate your time.

<!--
Please include **code** that reproduces the issue and whenever possible, an **image** that demonstrates the issue. Please upload images to GitHub, not to third-party file hosting sites. If necessary, add the image to a zip or tar archive.

The best reproductions are self-contained scripts with minimal dependencies. If you are using a framework such as Plone, Django, or Buildout, try to replicate the issue just using Pillow.
