Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

Python 3.8
^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow has dropped support for Python 3.8,
which reached end-of-life in October 2024.

PSFile
^^^^^^

The :py:class:`!PSFile` class was removed in Pillow 11 (2024-10-15).
This class was only made as a helper to be used internally,
so there is no replacement. If you need this functionality though,
it is a very short class that can easily be recreated in your own code.

PyAccess and Image.USE_CFFI_ACCESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Pillow's C API is now faster than PyAccess on PyPy, ``PyAccess`` has been
removed. Pillow's C API will now be used on PyPy instead.

``Image.USE_CFFI_ACCESS``, for switching from the C API to PyAccess, was
similarly removed.

Deprecations
============

FreeType 2.9.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. deprecated:: 11.0.0

Support for FreeType 2.9.0 is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 12.0.0
(2025-10-15), when FreeType 2.9.1 will be the minimum supported.

We recommend upgrading to at least FreeType `2.10.4`_, which fixed a severe
vulnerability introduced in FreeType 2.6 (:cve:`CVE-2020-15999`).

.. _2.10.4: https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.10.4/

ImageMath.lambda_eval and ImageMath.unsafe_eval options parameter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``options`` parameter in :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageMath.lambda_eval()` and
:py:meth:`~PIL.ImageMath.unsafe_eval()` has been deprecated. One or more
keyword arguments can be used instead.

JpegImageFile.huffman_ac and JpegImageFile.huffman_dc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. deprecated:: 11.0.0

The ``huffman_ac`` and ``huffman_dc`` dictionaries on JPEG images were unused. They
have been deprecated, and will be removed in Pillow 12 (2025-10-15).

Specific WebP Feature Checks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``features.check("transp_webp")``, ``features.check("webp_mux")`` and
``features.check("webp_anim")`` are now deprecated. They will always return
``True`` if the WebP module is installed, until they are removed in Pillow
12.0.0 (2025-10-15).

Other Changes

Python 3.13
^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow 10.4.0 had wheels built against Python 3.13 beta, available as a preview to help
others prepare for 3.13, and to ensure Pillow could be used immediately at the release
of 3.13.0 final (2024-10-01, :pep:`719`).

Pillow 11.0.0 now officially supports Python 3.13.

C-level Flags
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some compiling flags like ``WITH_THREADING``, ``WITH_IMAGECHOPS``, and other
``WITH_*`` were removed. These flags were not available through the build system,
but they could be edited in the C source.
