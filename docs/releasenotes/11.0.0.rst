Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

PSFile
^^^^^^

The :py:class:`!PSFile` class was removed in Pillow 11 (2024-10-15).
This class was only made as a helper to be used internally,
so there is no replacement. If you need this functionality though,
it is a very short class that can easily be recreated in your own code.
