Backwards Incompatible Changes
==============================

Python 3.8
^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow has dropped support for Python 3.8,
which reached end-of-life in October 2024.

PSFile
^^^^^^

The :py:class:`!PSFile` class was removed in Pillow 11 (2024-10-15).
This class was only made as a helper to be used internally,
so there is no replacement. If you need this functionality though,
it is a very short class that can easily be recreated in your own code.

PyAccess and Image.USE_CFFI_ACCESS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Pillow's C API is now faster than PyAccess on PyPy, ``PyAccess`` has been
removed. Pillow's C API will now be used on PyPy instead.

``Image.USE_CFFI_ACCESS``, for switching from the C API to PyAccess, was
similarly removed.
