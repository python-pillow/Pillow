4.0.0
-----

Python 2.6 and 3.2 Dropped
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow 4.0 no longer supports Python 2.6 and 3.2. We will not be
creating binaries, testing, or retaining compatibility with these
releases. This release removes some workarounds for those Python
releases, so the final working version of Pillow on 2.6 or 3.2 is 3.4.2.

Support added for Python 3.6
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow 4.0 supports Python 3.6.

OleFileIO.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^

``OleFileIO.py`` has been removed as a vendored file and is now installed
from the upstream :pypi:`olefile` PyPI package. All internal dependencies are
redirected to the olefile package. Direct accesses to
``PIL.OlefileIO`` raises a deprecation warning, then patches the
upstream olefile into ``sys.modules`` in its place.

SGI image save
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is now possible to save images in modes ``L``, ``RGB``, and
``RGBA`` to the uncompressed SGI image format.

Zero sized images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow 3.4.0 removed support for creating images with (0,0) size. This
has been reenabled, restoring pre 3.4 behavior.

Internal handles_eof flag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``handles_eof flag`` for decoding images has been removed, as there
were no internal users of the flag. Anyone maintaining image decoders
outside of the Pillow source tree should consider using the cleanup
function pointers instead.

Image.core.stretch removed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The stretch function on the core image object has been removed. This
used to be for enlarging the image, but has been aliased to resize
recently.
