Fix Regression with reading DPI from EXIF data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some JPEG images don't contain DPI information in the image metadata,
but do contain it in the EXIF data. A patch was added in 4.1.0 to read
from the EXIF data, but it did not accept all possible types that
could be included there.  This fix adds the ability to read ints as
well as rational values.

Incompatibility between 3.6.0 and 3.6.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CPython 3.6.1 added a new symbol, PySlice_GetIndicesEx, which was not
present in 3.6.0. This had the effect of causing binaries compiled on
CPython 3.6.1 to not work on installations of C-Python 3.6.0. This fix
undefines PySlice_GetIndicesEx if it exists to restore compatibility
with both 3.6.0 and 3.6.1. See https://bugs.python.org/issue29943 for
more details.
