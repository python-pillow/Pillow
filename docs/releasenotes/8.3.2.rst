8.3.2
-----

Security
========

* :cve:`CVE-2021-23437`: Avoid a potential ReDoS (regular expression denial of service)
  in :py:class:`~PIL.ImageColor`'s :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageColor.getrgb` by raising
  :py:exc:`ValueError` if the color specifier is too long. Present since Pillow 5.2.0.

* Fix 6-byte out-of-bounds (OOB) read. The previous bounds check in ``FliDecode.c``
  incorrectly calculated the required read buffer size when copying a chunk, potentially
  reading six extra bytes off the end of the allocated buffer from the heap. Present
  since Pillow 7.1.0. This bug was found by Google's `OSS-Fuzz`_ `CIFuzz`_ runs.

Other Changes
=============

Python 3.10 wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow now includes binary wheels for Python 3.10.

The Python 3.10 release candidate was released on 2021-08-03 with the final release due
2021-10-04 (:pep:`619`). The CPython core team strongly encourages maintainers of
third-party Python projects to prepare for 3.10 compatibility. And as there are `no ABI
changes`_ planned we are releasing wheels to help others prepare for 3.10, and ensure
Pillow can be used immediately on release day of 3.10.0 final.

Fixed regressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Ensure TIFF ``RowsPerStrip`` is multiple of 8 for JPEG compression (:pr:`5588`).

* Updates for :py:class:`~PIL.ImagePalette` channel order (:pr:`5599`).

* Hide FriBiDi shim symbols to avoid conflict with real FriBiDi library (:pr:`5651`).
