API Changes
===========

Optional channels for TIFF files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow can now open TIFF files with base modes of ``RGB``, ``YCbCr``,
and ``CMYK`` with up to 6 8-bit channels, discarding any extra
channels if the content is tagged as UNSPECIFIED.  Pillow still does
not store more than 4 8-bit channels of image data.

API Additions

Append to PDF Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Images can now be appended to PDF files in place by passing in
``append=True`` when saving the image.

New BLP File Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow now supports reading the BLP "Blizzard Mipmap" file format used
for tiles in Blizzard's engine.

Other Changes
=============

WebP memory leak
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A memory leak when opening ``WebP`` files has been fixed.
