Check for zlib-ng
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can check if Pillow has been built against the zlib-ng version of the
zlib library, and what version of zlib-ng is being used::

    from PIL import features
    features.check_feature("zlib_ng")  # True or False
    features.version_feature("zlib_ng")  # "2.2.2" for example, or None

Other Changes
=============

Saving JPEG 2000 CMYK images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With OpenJPEG 2.5.3 or later, Pillow can now save CMYK images as JPEG 2000 files.

zlib-ng in wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Wheels are now built against zlib-ng for improved speed. In tests, saving a PNG
was found to be more than twice as fast at higher compression levels.
