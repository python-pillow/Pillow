AVIF support in wheels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support for reading and writing AVIF images is now included in Pillow's wheels, with
libaom available as an encoder and dav1d as a decoder.

Python 3.14 beta
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help other projects prepare for Python 3.14, wheels are now built for the
3.14 beta as a preview. This is not official support for Python 3.14, but rather
an opportunity for you to test how Pillow works with the beta and report any
problems.
