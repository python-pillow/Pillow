8.3.1
-----

Fixed regression converting to NumPy arrays
===========================================

This fixes a regression introduced in 8.3.0 when converting an image to a NumPy array
with a ``dtype`` argument.

.. code-block:: pycon

    >>> from PIL import Image
    >>> import numpy
    >>> im = Image.new("RGB", (100, 100))
    >>> numpy.array(im, dtype=numpy.float64)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: __array__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
    >>>

Catch OSError when checking if destination is sys.stdout
========================================================

In 8.3.0, a check to see if the destination was ``sys.stdout`` when saving an image was
updated. This lead to an OSError being raised if the environment restricted access.

The OSError is now silently caught.

Fixed removing orientation in ImageOps.exif_transpose
=====================================================

In 8.3.0, :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageOps.exif_transpose` was changed to ensure that the
original image EXIF data was not modified, and the orientation was only removed from
the modified copy.

However, for certain images the orientation was already missing from the modified
image, leading to a KeyError.

This error has been resolved, and the copying of metadata to the modified image
improved.
