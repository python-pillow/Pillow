Security
========

This release fixes several buffer overruns and DOS attacks. 

:cve:`2019-19911`: DOS attack vulnerability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an FPX image reports that it has a large number of bands, a large amount of
resources will be used when trying to process the image. This is fixed by
limiting the number of bands to those usable by Pillow.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Overflow checks have been added when calculating the size of a memory block to be reallocated
in the processing of a TIFF image.

:cve:`2020-5311`: Overflow checks added to SGI image processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buffer overruns were found when processing an SGI image. Checks have been added to prevent this.

:cve:`2020-5312`: Overflow checks added to PCX image processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Buffer overruns were found when processing a PCX image. Checks have been added to prevent this.

:cve:`2020-5313`: Overflow checks added to FLI image processing
