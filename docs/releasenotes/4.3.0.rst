4.3.0
-----

Get One Channel From Image
==========================

New method :py:meth:`PIL.Image.Image.getchannel` added.
It returns single channel by index or name. For example,
``image.getchannel("A")`` will return alpha channel as separate image.
``getchannel`` should work up to 6 times faster than ``image.split()[0]``
in previous Pillow versions.

Removed Core Image Debugging Code
=================================

Debugging code within ``Image.core.grabclipboard`` was removed. It had been
marked as ``will be removed in future versions`` since PIL. When enabled, it
identified the format of the clipboard data.


Partial Resampling
==================

New argument ``box`` for :py:meth:`PIL.Image.Image.resize` method allows
set rect within source image which will be resized.
This is very similar to ``image.crop(box).resize(size)`` sequence
except that ``box`` can be with subpixel accuracy.


Loading 16-bit TIFF Images
==========================

Pillow now can read 16-bit multichannel TIFF files including files
with alpha transparency. Such files are converted to internal
8-bit representation.


Performance
===========

Many performance improvements were done, including:

* Many memory bandwidth-bounded operations such as crop, image allocation,
  conversion, split into bands and merging from bands
  are accelerated up to 2 times
* Upscaling of multichannel images (such as RGB) is accelerated by 5-10%
* Using recent libjpeg-turbo version (most installations nowadays)
  JPEG loading is accelerated up to 15% and JPEG saving up to 20%


Import and Export bytes on big-endian systems
=============================================

Methods :py:func:`PIL.Image.frombytes` and :py:meth:`PIL.Image.Image.tobytes`
used to import/export bytes for ``I`` (32-bit integer) and
``F`` (32-bit float) modes in platform-specific bytes order.
Now they work in little-endian mode, which is aligned with
internal documentation and other modes. If you need native bytes order,
you should explicitly use rawmodes with native bytes order:
``I;32N`` and ``F;32N``.


Removed Internal Methods
========================

From time to time we are cleaning up our internal API,
which is however accessible from the Python code.
This time ``PIL.Image.core.copy`` and ``PIL.Image.Image.im.copy2`` methods
were removed.
